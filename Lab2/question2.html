    <p>Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is a major festival celebrated in India and by communities around the world.
 It is observed annually on the new moon day of the Hindu month of Kartik, marking the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil.
 The festival commemorates the return of Lord Rama, Sita, and Lakshman to Ayodhya after their 14-year exile and the defeat of the demon king Ravana.
 People celebrate by thoroughly cleaning and decorating their homes with lamps, colorful lights, and intricate rangoli designs.
 Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of wealth and prosperity, is worshipped during the festival, and families offer prayers for happiness and abundance.
 Sharing sweets and exchanging gifts with loved ones strengthens social bonds and spreads joy.
 The vibrant atmosphere is enhanced by the bursting of firecrackers and the lighting of diyas, symbolizing hope, positivity, and the journey from darkness to light.</p>

<p>Bhai Dooj is also known by various names such as Bhaubeej, Bhai Tika, and Yama Dwitiya.
The festival is deeply connected to the mythological story of Lord Yamraj and his sister Yamuna, where Yamraj blessed that any brother receiving tilak from his sister on this day would be protected from untimely death.
Another significant legend recounts Lord Krishna visiting his sister Subhadra after defeating the demon Narakasura, which is also a key reason for the festival's celebration.
The ritual involves sisters applying a sacred tilak on their brothers' foreheads, followed by aarti and the sharing of food, symbolizing the unbreakable bond of love and protection between siblings.
The festival is celebrated not only in India but also in Nepal, where it is known as Bhai Tika, and in other countries with Hindu communities.</p>

 alt="Chhath Pooja" height="300px" width="500px" title="Chhath Pooja" >  
 <p>Chhath Puja is a four-day Hindu festival dedicated to the worship of the Sun God (Surya Dev) and his sister, Chhathi Maiya, a divine form of Devi Prakriti.
 It is primarily celebrated in the Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, and parts of West Bengal and Odisha, as well as in the Madhesh region of Nepal.
 The festival occurs on the sixth day of the lunar month of Kartik, following Diwali, and involves a series of rituals including a 36-hour nirjala fast (without food or water), bathing in holy rivers, and offering Arghya (prayers) to the setting and rising sun.
 The celebrations begin with Nahay Khay, where devotees take a holy bath and consume simple, pure food.
 The second day, Kharna, involves a strict fast until sunset, followed by breaking the fast with kheer and roti.
 On the third day, Sandhya Arghya, devotees offer prayers at sunset while standing waist-deep in a river or water body.
 The festival concludes on the fourth day, Usha Arghya, with prayers offered to the rising sun at dawn.
 The festival is believed to bring blessings of health, prosperity, and the fulfillment of wishes, especially for those seeking children, and is considered a significant expression of gratitude to the Sun God for sustaining life.</p>
